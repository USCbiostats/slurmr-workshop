# About the semminar

**Abstract** The Slurm job-scheduler (currently used by USC) provides a flexible infrastructure for all your computing needs. From submitting a single-core-long-running-job to complex multi-node-tasks, Slurm covers all scientists' needs in terms of computational resources management. The R programming language, although not HPC-ready, has multiple community-based solutions to integrate your computational pipeline with HPC settings, including Slurm. In this workshop, we will illustrate how to use R with USC's HPC cluster, covering from the very basics, like submitting a simple R script, to the more complex-powerful settings, like using multinode socket clusters using dozens or hundreds of cores in the same R session. The workshop will be led by USC's Division of Biostatistics at the Keck School of Medicine.
