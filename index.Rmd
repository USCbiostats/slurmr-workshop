# Materials

All the contents of this repository can be downloaded from the following 
github repository

https://github.com/USCbiostats/slurmR-workshop

You can also download all the contents of this repository (including R and bash
scripts) using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/USCbiostats/slurmr-workshop.git
```

The [**slurmR R package**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=slurmR){target="_blank"} can be
installed directly from CRAN:

```r
install.package("slurmR")
```

Or from Github using the [**remotes R package**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes){target="_blank"}:

```r
remotes::install_github("USCbiostats/slurmR")
```

All the examples here can be executed using GNU make. The command line entries
used to run each one of the tasks follow (see the [Makefile](Makefile){target="_blank"}):

```{r}
make <- readLines("Makefile")
make <- make[grepl("^[^a-zA-Z0-9]", make)]
make <- gsub("(^\\s+|\\s*&.*$)", "", make, perl = TRUE)
cat2(make, sep="\n", lang = "bash")
```

The last example can be executed directly while on the login node

```bash
module load usc r
Rscript -e 'slurmR::sourceSlurm("05-sapply.R", plan = "submit")'
```

This will submit a job without the need to write a slurm script!

> Lynn Ann Conway (born January 2, 1938) is an American computer scientist,
electrical engineer, inventor, and transgender activist. Conway is notable for
a number of pioneering achievements. She worked at IBM in the 1960s and is
credited with the invention of **generalized dynamic instruction handling**, a key
advance used in **out-of-order execution**, used by most modern computer processors
to improve performance. -- ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Conway))
